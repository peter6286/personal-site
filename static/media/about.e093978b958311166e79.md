# Intro

I’m Shuorong Zhu, a software engineer with a strong foundation in full-stack development, data engineering, and scalable systems. I’ve contributed to high-impact platforms, including my current work as a Full-Stack Developer at GEICO, where I help build and optimize core insurance functionalities for millions of users. My past experience includes data pipeline optimization using Spark and HDFS, cloud-native development with Spring Boot and AWS, and machine learning integration in IoT projects such as Evergreen, a smart plant care system.

Beyond work, I enjoy leading interdisciplinary teams and developing products that solve real-world problems, from campus-scale wholesale platforms to safety-focused mobile apps. I’m passionate about building intelligent, reliable systems that improve lives—and I’m always open to impactful collaborations.

# Some History

I was born and raised in Guangzhou, China, where I completed my early education before moving to the United States for higher studies. Growing up in a family deeply rooted in the computer science industry—both of my parents are professionals in the field—I developed a strong interest in technology from a young age. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Rutgers University–New Brunswick, where I built a solid foundation in software development and system design. To further deepen my expertise, I pursued and recently completed my Master’s degree in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), focusing on full-stack development, distributed systems, and data engineering.
